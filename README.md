# Machine Learning Library in C

A lightweight machine learning library implemented in C, designed for educational purposes and embedded systems. This library includes simple implementations of linear regression and logistic regression.

## Features

- Basic data structures: Vector and Matrix
- Machine learning algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
- Gradient descent optimization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- `make` (optional, if using the Makefile)
- `cmake` (optional, if using CMake for building)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RuslanAMandell/Machine-Learning-Library-C.git
   cd Machine-Learning-Library-C
